# emergent_interp

I refactored the code after finishing analysis, so the file paths in the code may not be correct

Work for replicating [Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs (Betley et. al)](https://martins1612.github.io/emergent_misalignment_betley.pdf) is in finetune/

Work for training the crosscoder is in crosscoder-model-diff-replication/, which is adapted from work from [here (Kissane, et. al)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/srt6JXsRMtmqAJavD/open-source-replication-of-anthropic-s-crosscoder-paper-for)

The analysis notebook is located in that directory as well, also based on a notebook from that post.
